# FirstBank - BadBank

**Three Tiers Banking Application**

**Description:** This is one of my first applications in React connected to a server and a database. It is a simple bank application accepting deposits and withdrawals. The application is separated in client (front-end) and back-end. The back-end is built using Express server and MongoDB. Authentication is done with Firebase.

**Installation Guidelines:** How to get your project up and running:
1. Create a Firebase Project using the Firebase Console.
1. Enable email and password in the Auth section.
1. Download Robo 3T
1. Clone or download this repo
1. Install dependencies locally by running: npm install at the back-end and client folders
1. Set up MongoDB with Docker by running $docker run -p 27017:27017 --name badbank -d mongo
1. Run npm install mongodb
1. Start the front end running npm start
1. start the back-end running the node index.js

**Technology used:** 
1. Node.js
1. Express

1. Robo 3T

**Features & Roadmap:** The application needs improvement, especially on the user authentication, which will be completed in the following weeks.
