# FirstBank - BadBank

**Three Tiers Banking Application**

**Description:** This is a work in progress of my first applications in React connected to a server and a database. It is a simple bank application accepting deposits and withdrawals. The application is separated in front-end (client) and back-end. The back-end is built using Express server and MongoDB. Front end authentication is done with Firebase and user data is stored in MongoDB.

**Installation Guidelines:** How to get your project up and running:
1. Create a Firebase Project using the Firebase Console.
1. Enable email and password in the Auth section.
1. Download Robo 3T
1. Clone or download this repo
1. Install dependencies locally by running: npm install at the back-end and client folders
1. Set up MongoDB with Docker by running $docker run -p 27017:27017 --name badbank -d mongo
1. Run npm install mongodb
1. Start the front end running npm start
1. start the back-end running the node index.js

**Technology used:** 
1. Node.js
1. Express
1. React
1. Docker
1. MongoDB

1. Robo 3T

**Features & Roadmap:** The application needs improvement, specifically as it relates to user authentication and authorization. This will be completed in the following months.
